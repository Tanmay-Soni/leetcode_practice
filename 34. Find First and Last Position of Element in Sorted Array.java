/**
 * LeetCode Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/
 * 
 * üí≠ Thought Process:
 * - Since the array is sorted, I knew binary search would be the most efficient approach.
 * - But finding the target once was not enough in this case as I needed the first and last occurence of the target.
 * - So I used two separate binary searches: one to find the first occurrence, one to find the last.
 * 
 * ‚úÖ Final Approach:
 * - In `findFirst()`:
 *    - When I find the target, I check if it's the first index or the previous element is smaller.
 *    - If yes, I return that index. If not, I move left to keep searching.
 * - In `findLast()`:
 *    - When I find the target, I check if it's the last index or the next element is greater.
 *    - If yes, I return that index. If not, I move right to keep searching.
 * 
 * ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
 * - O(log n) for both searches, so total is O(log n)
 * 
 * üß† Space Complexity:
 * - O(1), since I‚Äôm not using any extra space.
 * 
 * üß™ Edge Cases:
 * - Empty array
 * - Target not in array
 * - Target at the very beginning or end
 * - Array with all elements equal to target
 * 
 * üìå Notes:
 * - I avoided doing a linear search for finding the first or last occurence from the middle to prevent O(n) worst-case.
 * - Used Binary search to narrow down the exact first and last positions helped keeping O(log n) total time complexity.
